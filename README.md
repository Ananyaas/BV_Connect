BV_Connect - A platform to connect Humans of Banasthali Vidyapith at Ease

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

Over a great period, many issues have been faced by our students of our University to connect with each other, to rent or buy/sell second hand hostel essentials or books/notes or to simply take advice from seniors on a relevent subject. 
This problem has further exceeded during the tough times of COVID when students lacked communication and suggestions from seniors and alumni.Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields 
and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

Our project BV_Connect hence, can play a vital role in connecting the students of Banasthali University at ease and can help as a on stop platform to buy/sell second hand items, communicate with seniors/alumni, chat within themselves on relevent topics and gain 
knowledge about recent clubs' activities going around in the campus or even virtually in remote locations. This application currently allows the student to sign up or sign in using university credentials which then further are utilized by different features.  The 
project's scope is to extend and add four chat rooms which will play the seperate roles of four features - Club Notice Board, Alumni Connect, Buy/Sell,Ask & Answer.
